Initial:
    - MUST play songs through audio output
    - MUST use a song queue system to select play order
    - MUST display the queue onto the UI
    - MUST allowers users to use UI to queue songs from spotify
    - MUST allow connection to one bluetooth device
    - SHOULD allow users to remove songs from the queue
    - SHOULD Connect to two bluetooth devices
    - SHOULD have a mobile friendly UI
    - COULD allow users to clear the queue
    - COULD use a QR code to allow access to local site
    - WON'T attempt to synchronise between devices
    - WON'T deploy to cloud

Ideas: 
    - Database 
    - Users can login and add things from spotify playlist
    - Users can login via google/spotify to persist playlists
    - Users can add music via youtube
    - Users can be assigned ranks for a "big session"
    - Sessions can be used to play music to multiple/different speakers
    - Connecting to multiple speakers per session
    - Cloud deployments
    - Song stats
    - Historic songs
    - Favourites (is this playlists)
